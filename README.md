# Days_with_ML
What is Machine Learning:
ML is a branch of AI which focusses on use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that human learn, gradualy improving its accuracy

Traditional Programming in which developers were to specify patterns/rules in a data 
whereas 
Machine learning in which Computer finding the pattern in the data

Types of Machine Learning are:-
Supervised ML
Unsupervised ML
Semi-Supervised ML
Re-inforcement learning

Life cycle of ML is:-
1. Loading of data
2. Examine the data
3. Split the dataset (Training and testing)
4. Visualize the data
5. Data pre-processing
6. Train the model
7. Evaluate the model
